												<p class="to-shave ddd-truncated" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1. Build brand recognition.
Hosting events promotes your brand. Which allows event attendees to connect and engage with your brands strategic aims.
</p> 		
						<div class="jb"><p><strong>EVENT BENEFITS FOR BUSINESSES</strong></p>
<p>2. Network
Events allow businesses to connect with their clients and audiences on a personal level which has an impact in relation to how a business is perceived.<br><br>

3. Strengthen your community.
In addition to developing a connection with your organisation, people attending your events can build relationships with each other and strengthen the community.<br><br>

4. Build trust.
Trust is an important component of any brands success. By hosting events a brand can create real tangible experiences and attendees will be able to connect with a brands mission.<br><br>

5. Generate revenue.
Charging for admission to your event can generate revenue.<br><br>

6. Fundraise.
Giving back to your community and society at large is a great way to raise awareness about an important cause, and gain recognition for your organisation.<br><br>

8. Establish thought leadership.
Holding a seminar or hosting a meet up for industry thought leaders establishes your business or organisation as a driver of new ideas and collaboration. This provides value to your community and helps to establish your business as a valued resource.<br><br>

9. Have fun.
What could be better than seeing everyone have a great time? If people enjoy themselves at your event, they will return time and time again.<br><br>

Hosting events can really benefit your organisation in so many ways. Plus, planning and spreading the word about your great, upcoming events is so much easier when you have an event marketing calendar to simplify the process and save you time.<br><br>

At ASA Events Management and Consultancy Specialists we relish at actualising our client’s eventideas and making the impossible become reality.<br><br>

<br>

We demonstrate our expertise regularly by producing and executing independent events for the general public and various other groups. Producing conferences, networking events, gala’s and other corporate and social events, especially those that require a special creative touch and efficiency of delivery, is something we have a passion for. We put maximum effort into our events and easily transfer that effort into producing and executing events for clients.<br><br>

In addition to the above event production and planning services ASA Events Management & Consultancy Specialists offer an event coordination service. To ensure a smooth delivery we enjoy being on hand to coordinate all aspects of the event. We have a passion for seeing an event run smoothly so that attendees and clients can get full enjoyment out of the event experience.<br><br>

As well as producing, planning and coordinating superior events ASA Events Management & Consultancy Specialists offer a consultation service for those who require assistance somewhere short of full event management. Perhaps, as a client, you wish to arrange and deliver an event but realise that expert assistance would be helpful.

Work with ASA Event Management & Consultancy Specialists LTD’s corporate event planners for a truly special corporate event. We take the time to consider how to match your brand with your corporate event.<br>
Event planning involves a creative process for us and we take it seriously so that our clients can know that the event planned with us will satisfy their corporate expectations.

Whether it is a business lunch or a networking event we have a passion for executing an event that is attractive to our clients but also functional. For example, we could deliver a beautiful gala for a networking purpose, including dinner. Some clients prefer a sterile environment so that they can concentrate on work at their corporate event. However, not all corporate events are the same. A team-building exercise, for example, may be very different from a presentation stylistically speaking. Either way, ASA Event Management & Consultancy Specialists LTD has the knowhow to put together and execute the most appropriate type of event for our clients.<br><br>

Can you imagine an evening filled with entertainment, exquisite food and great company in an atmosphere carefully crafted to impress as well as to add to the enjoyment of the evening?

The entrance of any event is an opportunity to arrest yourattendee’s eyes and tease them with regards to what to expect next!<br><br>

3. Second Impression
Now that guests have been wowed at the entrance and had their attention diverted on their way to the main event space. This is an opportunity to make all attendees aware of what message this event is attempting to convey.<br><br>

We have a passion for seeing an event run smoothly so that attendees and clients can get full enjoyment out of the event experience.<br><br>

As well as producing, planning and coordinating superior events ASA Events Management & Consultancy Specialists offer a consultation service for those who require assistance somewhere short of full event management. Perhaps, as a client, you wish to arrange and deliver an event but realise that expert assistance would be helpful. This sort of situation is where ASA will be able to provide consultation to help you ensure that an efficiently delivered and high-quality event is the result.<br><br>

						<div class="jb"><p><strong>ABOUT OUR CORPORATE EVENTS</strong></p>
<p>

Work with ASA Event Management & Consultancy Specialists LTD’s corporate event planners for a truly special corporate event. We take the time to consider how to match your brand with your corporate event.<br>
Event planning involves a creative process for us and we take it seriously so that our clients can know that the event planned with us will satisfy their corporate expectations. The main aim of our corporate event planning process is to ensure that the event is smoothly executed and appropriately crafted to fit with the particular company brand.<br><br>

ASA Event Management & Consultancy Specialists LTD can deliver all your corporate event planning requirements. Whether it is a business lunch or a networking event we have a passion for executing an event that is attractive to our clients but also functional. For example, we could deliver a beautiful gala for a networking purpose, including dinner. Some clients prefer a sterile environment so that they can concentrate on work at their corporate event. However, not all corporate events are the same. A team-building exercise, for example, may be very different from a presentation stylistically speaking. Either way, ASA Event Management & Consultancy Specialists LTD has the knowhow to put together and execute the most appropriate type of event for our clients.<br><br>

Just show up and enjoy a fantastic time with us as we will take care of everything. The Mansion Party is ideal for those looking to have a great time in a fresh and new environment with no worries. Events are what we do so come along and dance the night away with us. We will provide more information soon.<br><br>

With regards to any corporate event I plan, the first thing I think about is how can I tie this event back to the brand? I want to achieve more than just place a logo on a wall. I want to design something that really stands out, connects with the message of my client’s company and is unique enough that guests will want to share the visuals via social media. This ensure that the gains traction on social media and is not just another photo of a party but is something that encourages brand engagement.<br><br>

1. The Entrance
The entrance of any event is an opportunity to arrest yourattendee’s eyes and tease them with regards to what to expect next!<br><br>

2. The Walk
This area creates a holding pattern where guests will be waiting to check-in and you will have their attention, you do not want to lose the event excitement created with the entrance décor!<br><br>

3. Second Impression
Now that guests have been wowed at the entrance and had their attention diverted on their way to the main event space. This is an opportunity to make all attendees aware of what message this event is attempting to convey.<br><br>

At ASA Events Management and Consultancy Specialists we relish at actualising our client’s event ideas and making the impossible become reality.<br><br>
