                                    <p class=" hideMO">Our aim was to execute a stunning product launch for a brand of beautiful and quality leather bags. We were excited to work on this project particularly because the bags were excellent quality and we knew that consumers would be getting a really durable yet fashionable item.<br><br>

This particular product made for a great product launch because potential customers could get quite hands on with the product and get to grips with the quality of the product. We made sure the product was on display so that potential customers could interact with the product. As we were confident in the quality of the product this was an obvious way to highlight the beautiful craftsmanship put into each bag.

                                        It was an obvious choice to hold the product launch within an open plan environment where we could personally engage with potential customers and answer any questions about the product in an informed manner and within a relaxed environment.

                                       Our team was focused on speaking to customers and explaining the features of the product. The fact that each bag was beautifully crafted was a great selling point. However, we also wanted each potential buyer to get to know product in order to remember the product favourably. We ensured that this was the case by utilising informational materials.<br><br>

The main aim for the product launch was consumer awareness and sales. This was our initial aim as part of a more comprehensive marketing plan. The idea was to increase consumer awareness and knowledge of the brand and the products under the brand umbrella at the launch.

The result was a well-managed and coordinated networking event where attendees and presenters were looked after to their satisfaction. 
The event was carried out with careful attention paid to all aspects of event management to ensure a good experience for attendees,
presenters and those involved with hiring out the event space and equipment etc.

On your wedding day there are many elements to consider to ensure that the special day is a pleasurable experience. Here is a checklist for the big day:<br><br>

Our glamorous bride required her hair and makeup to be exquisitely and creatively prepared which we had arranged. It is often lovely to catch some photographs of the bride during the hair and makeup application when the bride is looking particularly beautiful. The bride’s hair and makeup requires about two hours to attend to all the details.<br><br>

The bridesmaid’s hair and makeup also required special attention and were professionally attended to. The bridesmaids’ hair and makeup require about one and a half hours each.<br><br>

The photographer, therefore, needed to arrive while the bride was getting prepared so they could capture all the little details such as the gown, the shoes, and the jewellery.<br><br>

The stylist was asked to stick around to make sure all aspects were covered and to ensure the veil was properly secured after the gown was put on.<br><br>

We made time for pre-ceremony photos of the bride and her family and of the groom with his family. Some of the groom’s family got held up which caused a slight delay but we made sure we incorporated enough of a time window to accommodate.<br><br>

The groom and groomsmen arrived two hours before the ceremony. We would say one and a half hours but we wanted to leave a buffer.<br><br>

To make sure the guests didn’t see the bride we asked that the bride and bridesmaids arrived later, about one hour before the ceremony.<br><br>

The ceremony lasted about 30 minutes to give time for readings and music. It was long enough to help make all those precious moments memorable.<br><br>

There was a wonderful atmosphere during the receiving line which lasted about 15 minutes.<br><br>

The gap between the ceremony and the reception was about 40 minutes so everyone had time to mingle.<br><br>

We had some wonderful family photos were taken by a photographer. They took about 2 and a half minutes to organise everyone and take the shots.<br><br>

The bridal party photos took longer than the family photos. Some really beautiful shots were captured.<br><br>

Our photographer then went on to capture some stunning photos of the bride and groom. They took about 20 minutes to get some great shots of the lovely couple.
<br><br>
We saved time for pictures of large groups at the reception.<br><br>

The ideal length of time for the reception is six hours. We scheduled in about an hour for cocktails, about two hours for dinner and three hours for dancing.

                                       We engaged a lot of potential customers and made many sales on the day. It was a very successful launch as we focused on every detail to make sure everything came together. The planning for this launch was extensive and had to be approached carefully.<br><br>

Our client for this launch reported that they were really pleased with the effort we put in to make a success of the launch for the product and the brand. We took great care to refer to the marketing plan at each stage of the launch to ensure a successful result and we are happy to say it worked.
