                                        We will assist you in your events creation or we can create your event for you.
                                        By ascertaining your requirements at the initial consultation stage, we will
                                        customise our event service delivery to your needs. When it comes to event
                                        planning, creativity is very important. Our event planning team are always
                                        brimming with creative ideas and we love to implement them for clients.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Your event will involve a process of creative brainstorming and subsequent
                                        careful thought to resolve practical issues around the event service delivery.
                                        This process is always important for the successful execution of an event. We at
                                        ASA Events Management & Consultancy Specialists enjoy taking this process
                                        seriously for clients.

                                        This aspect of our service is an integral part of our event management service
                                        as all clients will be offered an initial consultation to ascertain their
                                        requirements. We also offer a separate event consultation service for clients
                                        requiring assistance short of full event planning and management.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The initial consultation will involve us assessing a potential client’s event
                                        requirements by asking a range of questions which will help us to serve a client
                                        in the best way. Once we have assessed a client’s event needs, we can proceed
                                        from there to present a proposal to the client. If the proposal is satisfactory
                                        to the client, we can then begin to iron out any other details and start working
                                        together.

                                        Our event consultation service involves a client booking in with us to receive a
                                        telephone call for an allotted period of time where we would offer advice
                                        involving their event. This is helpful for clients who have event requirements
                                        but do not necessarily need full event planning and management.
