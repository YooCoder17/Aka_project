                                      The best decision we made for our wedding was deciding to work with ASA Events Management & Consultancy Specialists Ltd! We were provided with two wedding planners and both did an outstanding job! We were guided through the entire process, made to feel totally at ease, given great recommendations with regards to vendors that were a great fit and able to achieve the aesthetic we were looking for. We were provided with a clear timeline and an outline of what to expect which is exactly what we needed as planning a wedding can be overwhelming. Our amazing wedding planners were organised, professional, detail-oriented, reliable, enthusiastic and pleasant to work with! I seriously have no complaints at all! I highly recommend ASA Events Management & Consultancy Specialists Ltd.

She took notes on everything and perfectly expressed my ideas. I was extremely happy with the service.
