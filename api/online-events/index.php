                                        A virtual event, also known as an online event, is an interactive gathering that
                                        happens on the internet. These types of events are not restricted to a single
                                        location. A remote attendee can join and participate from anywhere in the world
                                        provided the attendee has internet access.
                                        <br><br>

                                        Some of our events are completely virtual and guests can attend sessions from
                                        the comfort of their own home or office. Other Virtual Event Services we
                                        provided have both real-world and virtual components. Some attendees visit the
                                        actual event location and others stream the festivities from their computer.

                                        There are many reasons why virtual events are valuable. First off, virtual
                                        events allow the individuals or companies hosting them to reach a wider
                                        audience.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Virtual Events are inexpensive with regards to logistical factors. These cost
                                        savings can then be passed on to each virtual attendee in the form of lower
                                        ticket prices.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Virtual events are extremely measurable. Companies can easily learn which
                                        sessions were the most popular, how many people attended, where those attendees
                                        live, how they paid for their tickets, and much more. This information can then
                                        be used to improve event strategy.

                                        We would suggest a 3 to 4 otherwise the product can look overcrowded. However,
                                        our technology can handle up to 12 remote presenters on screen at a time.

                                        We can propose several platforms which offer enhanced security. For example, we
                                        can set a password that is sent to your invited guests which they then have to
                                        use to access the online event. Alternatively, we can set up a vigorous
                                        registration system where unique invite links are sent by email to each person
                                        who is eligible to attend, preventing them from forwarding the live stream link
                                        to uninvited guests.

                                        We have several interactive tools which can be integrated into your virtual
                                        event. We can embed a chat or Q & A sidebar alongside your video stream, and the
                                        host in the live studio can have a tablet or screen showing them what the
                                        audience is asking. This demonstrates to your audience that their comments and
                                        questions are being reviewed in real-time, encouraging further engagement.
