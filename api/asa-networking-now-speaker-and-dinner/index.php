                                    <p class=" hideMO">The aim for the event detailed here was to create an atmosphere where attendees, who were having a sit-down meal at a speaker’s event with us, would feel comfortable enough to absorb all the information at the event but also to remain alert enough to pay attention to the speaker.<br>

It can be a difficult balancing act when there is food involved as attendees may start feeling tired after eating. This would be an obstacle to attendees getting the most out of the event. But we had a menu prepared which wouldn’t be too heavy.

                                    <p class=" hideMO">We arranged a high-end corporate presentation room which was adapted. The room needed to be quite airy and bright to aid concentration during the presentation. But, during the meal, the setting needed to be more intimate to increase the enjoyment of the meal and to help attendees open up for networking.

                                       To achieve our aims for this event we employed professional waiters and waitresses who were adept at engaging with attendees at events to fulfil their event requirements. We also made sure the room had air conditioning so that the room remained airy during the speakers’ talks.<br>

The lighting needed to be flexible and able to be adapted to suit the requirements of the event. We had to employ a seating plan and we used flowers arranged on the tables to give the room a refined feel. The room also needed to have adequate sound systems so the speakers’ voice would travel around the room.

                                    <p class=" hideMO">The result was a great evening of networking and information gathering for our corporate clients. The meal was intimate and there was a bar area where attendees could network more effectively. We had the waiting staff carry drinks around this area to encourage networking at certain points during the event.<br>

The information and the networking were very useful according to some of our guests. We made a lot of effort to create the right surroundings to allow for ease of communication for the speaker’s and for attendees who wanted to network. The valet parking also was organised to a schedule so there were no problems for speakers and attendees getting into the event. It was a very successful evening.
